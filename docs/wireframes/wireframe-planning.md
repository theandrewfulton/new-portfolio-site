# Wireframe/mockup Planning

## Inspiration

### What I like so far:

https://mattfarley.ca/ - Wireframe graphics as a hero image, purple accent to break up page sections

https://caferati.me/ - materialising letter effect in the hero section. Really like the transition animation between pages but not sure how to go about doing this

http://www.emilyridge.ie/ - hover over projects is good but in this case very hard to read. I really like the navbar

https://pierre.io/ - footer with socials, cursor is cool but a bit distracting, I like the simple grey on black

https://denisechandler.com/ images rotate slightly when hovered over

https://benadam.me/ - so simple, so clean

https://jonny.me/ - hero becomes header

https://jacekjeznach.com/ - "lazy load" content, text animation. Skills word cloud!

## Features

frosted glass effect

gradient background??? - bit stuck on the background but would like blues and purples

would love to try and make Hero background colour become the header colour.

hamburger menu for mobile and horizontal navbar for tablet and desktop

One page or multiple page design?

grid or carousel for projects? - maybe grid for multi-page, carousel for one-page

I like the columns I have now but grid with extra information on hover might be the way to go.

Potential one-page:

- hero/basic introduction
- About/skills/resume
- projects
- blog
- contact

Home and About as one page?

Contact page with form - set up email address

Hover over image for Project information?

Split skills into 3 columns like Matt Farley for design, front-end and mentoring. Something like platforms, technologies/languages and work areas (pi, drones, photogrammetry etc.?)

Featured work on the homepage?

Footer with socials?

### Notes now that I'm working on it

bump navbar to top with some kind of animation when scrolling down?

Showcase component is most of the viewport height on mobile (at least for really small screens, then a certain size that accomodates all my content)

Touch targets for hamburger menu may be a little small. Full screen menu instead?

script to update copyright year

react component that takes a param to adjust width and height based on whether it's a project showcase or about section?

Individual Project pages or links to gitHub?

Allow 2 cards in a column on projects page but not on about page?

social media button section on every page

each "layer" above background has same border width in to the previous layer

Some spiel on the Contact page to take up space?

red on top layer frosted glass around desktop navbar?

turn navbar from red to default blue/purple on scroll?

Mobile navbar has my name as a wordmark and condenses to AF in the corner on scroll?

Fonts:

Should fonts look etched/printed on the glass?

Wordmark: Caveat

Headings: Raleway

Body: Raleway or Roboto Slab or Roboto? The full mockup cureently shows Roboto Slab
