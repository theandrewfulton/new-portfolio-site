## Purpose

The purpose of this portfolio site is to showcase my skills,  projects, work history, and to a certain degree my personality to  potential employers, collaborators and clients. It needs to do this in a functional, well laid out, clear and concise manner.

## Target Audience

The target audience for this portfolio site are recruiters and  potential employers, clients and collaborators who may be interested in engaging me professionally in some form.

A second target audience are my friends, family and colleagues who  are interested in following my journey training as a web developer.

## Functionality and Features

The portfolio site contains a link to my Resume as a pdf on the About page and also features a Projects page and a link to my Medium articles, enabling me to showcase my achievements, knowledge and experience in the future, beyond just my Resume.
