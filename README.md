## Purpose

The purpose of this portfolio site is to showcase my skills,  projects, work history, and to a certain degree my personality to  potential employers, collaborators and clients. It needs to do this in a functional, well laid out, clear and concise manner.

## Target Audience

The target audience for this portfolio site are recruiters and  potential employers, clients and collaborators who may be interested in engaging me professionally in some form.

A second target audience are my friends, family and colleagues who  are interested in following my journey training as a web developer.

## Functionality and Features

The portfolio site contains a link to my Resume as a pdf on the About page and also features a Projects page and a link to my Medium articles, enabling me to showcase my achievements, knowledge and experience in the future, beyond just my Resume.

## Tech Stack

## Setup

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

## Wireframes

The wireframes for my portfolio site were made in Figma. They can be viewed [here](https://www.figma.com/file/am1oeEiXQoFJjtFyFQZexB/New-Portfolio-Site?node-id=0%3A1).

Colours and fonts were chosen and mocked up using the wireframes for the About page as a starting point.
